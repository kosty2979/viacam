Magic Zoom covers header on hover but it doesn't.

Hello.
As You can see on screenshot (http://image.prntscr.com/image/cab52910c25942afa442f71310f847e9.png)
magic zoom hover everything. Even header. I can't figure out how to make header to be over the MagicZoom picture.
Please, help me to apply some css or tell me the way to place Magic Zoom under the header.
Thank You.
